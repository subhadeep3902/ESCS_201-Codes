5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

- To run any program (with <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -lm```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- Then type ``` ./a.out```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.
