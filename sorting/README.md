## <b>Linear Search

``` Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. ```

        ->  Every element is considered as a potential match
            for the key and checked for the same.

        ->  If any element is found equal to the key, the
            search is successful and the index of that element is
            returned.

        ->  If no element is found equal to the key, the
            search yields "No match found".

## <b>Binary Search

```Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). ```
